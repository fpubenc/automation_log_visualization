# Automation Log Visualization
Visualizing errors in an automation log (MySQL database)

Circumstance: I had been experiencing heavy disruption to a series of my automations in our ecosystem. They were producing fatal errors to the container after a series of timeouts. In order to diagnose this, I had several tasks:

- Design a SQL query that could surface the magnitude of the issue
- Export the resultant dataset in CSV format and upload to Tableau
- Create a meaningful visualization of the data that easily expresses the issue's size and surfaces any relevant patterns

The result of my work may be viewed at this link: https://public.tableau.com/views/agent_graph/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
